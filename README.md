Description:
Sneat! is a side scrolling platformer with puzzle and stealth elements, navigate levels while staying in cover, eating and spitting out objects in order to hide from the Eye that watches. 



Controls:
- A / D (left and right movement)

- SpaceBar (Jump)

- E (consume an object -  must be facing the direction of the object)

- F (Spit out an object - try running and jumping while spitting!)



Mechanics:

Objects and background terrain provide cover to you to hide from the Eye, you can pick up and place/throw objects to create cover between fixed terrain. 

While exposed, you have a limited amount of time to return to cover before you begin losing the time to complete the level.
